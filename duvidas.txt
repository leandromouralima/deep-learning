Porque passar um vetor de (64,784) imputs de uma vez?
Porque n√£o passar uma figura de cada vez?

Porque ler em batches de 64 figuras?

Pytorch tem describe

Foward Pass - Get the outputs
Calculate the loss - With the right answers
Calculate the weights gradients of dloss/dw1 - backpropagation
Update the weigths with gradient descent (Stochastic Gradient Descent SGD)

And the bias?
Does it update the weights on all levels?
Using batches of 64 images it passses through all the available images (938 batches).
The losses are been reduced every batch, but the scrip shows only the mean loss of the whole epoch.
Can I do one epoch at a single interation? Is it too much memory consuming? What is the optimum batch?

Remember to clear the gradients
optimizer.zero_grad()
